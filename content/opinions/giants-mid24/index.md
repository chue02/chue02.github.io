_"All loss and no wins make Daboll a dull coach"_

# Introduction

So the Giants are staring at losing season... again.

Currently, the question Giants fans are asking _"should we fire Joe Schoen and/or Brian Daboll?"_ I'm hoping this question won't eventually turn into _"why did we fire them?"_

# The Grand Master: Joe Schoen

## The Drafts

Even the anti-Schoen camp has admitted that his most recent draft class is exemplary. Here's their progress report card:

#### 2024 Draft Class Grades

| Rnd | Pick |     Player     |   Pos   | Grade  |
| :-: | :--: | :------------: | :-----: | :----: |
|  1  |  6   |  Malik Nabers  |   WR    | **A+** |
|  2  |  47  |  Tyler Nubin   |    S    |   B+   |
|  3  |  70  | Andru Phillips |   CB    |   A    |
|  4  | 107  |  Theo Johnson  |   TE    |   C+   |
|  5  | 166  |  Tyrone Tracy  |   RB    |   A-   |
|  6  | 183  | Darius Muassau |   LB    |   C    |
|     |      |                | **Ovr** | **A-** |

So with results like these, why are fans still calling for Schoen's head? Moreover, why have the Giants failed to win 10 games over the last two season combined? Let's just say that it's not because this class was a problem, rather it's because the _previous_ draft classes have been an issue. Now here's _their_ progress report:

#### 2022 Draft Class Grades

| Rnd | Pick |      Player       | Pos |       Status        | Grade  |
| :-: | :--: | :---------------: | :-: | :-----------------: | :----: |
|  1  |  5   | Kayvon Thibodeaux | DE  |         IR          |   C-   |
|  1  |  7   |     Evan Neal     | OT  | Starting (finally?) | **F**  |
|  2  |  43  | Wan'Dale Robinson | WR  |      Starting       |   B-   |
|  3  |  67  |   Joshua Ezeudu   | OG  |       Active        |   D+   |
|  3  |  81  |   Cordale Flott   | CB  |      Starting       |   D+   |
|  4  | 112  | Daniel Bellinger  | TE  |       Active        |   C+   |
|  4  | 114  |    Dane Belton    | DB  |       Active        |   C+   |
|  5  | 146  |  Micah McFadden   | LB  |      Starting       | **A+** |
|  5  | 147  |    DJ Davidson    | DT  |       Active        |   B-   |
|  5  | 173  |  Marcus McKethan  | OG  |      Released       |   D-   |
|  6  | 182  |  Darrian Beavers  | LB  |      Released       |   D    |

Despite the fact that the 2022 draft class has nearly twice as many picks as the 2024 class (11 vs 6), the fact that this class is substantially less constructive than the 2024 class is... not ideal. Moreover, the fact that not one but _two_ top ten picks have been dramatically less than advertised doesn't help.

Still, one bad class isn't necessarily irreparable. Sure Schoen underperformed on what should be one of the more formative draft classes for a rebuilding team, but as long as the 2023 class is above average then he still has a shot of recovering from these setbacks and to resume progress on the rebuild.

#### 2023 Draft Class Grades

| Rnd | Pick |        Player        | Pos |  Status  | Grade |
| :-: | :--: | :------------------: | :-: | :------: | :---: |
|  1  |  24  |     Deonte Banks     | CB  | Starting |  C-   |
|  2  |  57  | John Michael Schmitz |  C  | Starting |   C   |
|  3  |  73  |     Jalin Hyatt      | WR  | Benched  |   D   |
|  5  | 172  |      Eric Gray       | RB  |  Active  |  D-   |
|  6  | 209  |     Tre Hawkins      | CB  |  Active  |  D-   |
|  7  | 243  |     Jordon Riley     | DL  |  Active  |   C   |
|  7  | 254  |   Gervarrius Owens   |  S  | Released |   F   |

Despite these results, I still do sympathize with Schoen (or at the very least, I am _trying_ to sympathize). Unlike Gettleman, these picks aren't utterly terrible initially, and ostensibly none of these picks were egregious reaches. Furthermore, in 2023 he wasn't exactly given "rebuild draft capital", as most teams in the rebuild phase usually pick top ten in year two while Schoen barely picked within the top 25. In fact, these picks were typically lauded in post-draft reactions, and many fans would've made the same moves if given his position (more on that later).

Additionally, his early round draft picks generally showed flashes of their potential. They did have where they struggled, but they also had games where they were they justified their draft position. They may not have been immediate impact players, but they didn't need to be as long as they _eventually_ became considerable contributors. There was still hope that these players just needed more time and experience in order to become the viable starters we hoped they'd be, particularly Schmitz and Neal who were affected by poor coaching from Bobby Johnson (more on him later).

However, these players didn't really progress, hence these drafts' mediocre grades. In fact, there's arguments they may have gotten worse. For instance, Banks went from allowing a 79.6 passer rating when targeted in 2023 to now allowing 138 in 2024. Schmitz, who went from having a disastrous rookie season, is now a mediocre starter. That's not necessarily terrible, especially since serviceable pass protection is what we've been imploring for for a decade, but that's still underwhelming. It doesn't help that Neal hasn't seemed to experienced the same benefits from our new OL coach, Carmon Bricillio. In fact, we haven't even seen if Neal can provide any dividends since he hasn't even played in nearly a year.

You could still argue that there needs to be even additional time before these players progress. NFL development is notoriously impatient, so a fair argument in favor of these picks (and by extension Schoen) is that critics want to harvest before cultivation. Conversly, a fair argument is that these picks may never cultivate, and we could have enjoyed a greater return of interest had we picked alternate players that were available.

Joey Porter Jr. was available for nearly 10 picks after Banks was selected (in fact the Giants actually traded up a spot to specifically pick Banks). Cedric Tilman and Josh Downs were both third rounders picked after Jaylin Hyatt. Puka Nacua was tantalizing close to being a Giant, as he was selected just five picks after Eric Gray was. It is still true we may still need to wait longer for a payoff, but it feels like we're waiting for our crops to sprout while watching other villages enjoy their banquets. Famine builds resentment against regimes.

As I alluded to earlier, Schoen made moves that fans would've made given our knowledge of these players. However, what distinguishes good managers from bad managers is knowing what the fans don't know. It's his job to make moves that may initially go against the grain, but are eventually astute picks. If Schoen had picked Garrett Wilson over Neal, he would've been shredded apart by analysts in April 2022. Regardless, what matters is that he'd be seen as a genius in November 2024.

It's also possibly fair to say these successful non-Giants players may not have been as impactful as they have been if they were selected by the Giants. You could argue there are confounding variables that affect development, such as coaching, how they complement other teammates' skillsets on the field, assistance from veterans, _quarterback performance_, etc. Nonetheless, these factors are still under Schoen's purview. General issues are tied to the general manager.

## Free Agency and Trades

Schoen's philosophy regarding free agency and trading is generally conservative. As a result, I don't feel as though I need to discuss these actions as extensively as I have with the draft. Still, he hasn't utterly neglected these facets of roster construction, and there's still a few notable moves to discuss.

#### Notable Free Agency Departures

Note: In my opinion these departures are too nuanced to summarize with a grade, so I deliberately excluded the column for this table.
