## ðŸš¨ Repo source

Forked from my older brother's repo, [lambertchu.com](https://lambertchu.com), which was forked from [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com). As per my brother's request, if you fork off this repo please link back his and Brittany Chiang's websites. Thanks!

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

### NOTE: This set-up is dated and may need to be modified.

You may need to switch nvm version 16 _before_ installing `gatsby-cli` as issues may arise if you are not on the correct nvm version for installation. In essence, you may need to swaps steps 1 and 2.

Also if you're wondering why there's an `index.html` file, it's because GitHub Pages requires it as an entry point. Its sole purpose of is to load the corresponding `index.js` file.

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Install and use Node v16 using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install 16

   nvm use 16
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

1. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
