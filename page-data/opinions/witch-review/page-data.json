I wanted to watch it with him, but he didn't want to scar me with a horror movie, so he wouldn't permit me to watch it. In retrospect, that makes complete sense. What didn't make sense was in order ensure I wouldn't dare watch, he told me that if I did I would die in 7 days.</p>\n<p>When my dad booted up the DVD, I initially tried my best to avoid even glancing at the movie. However, the mythos behind the film overwhelmed me. Why was my dad watching something that would kill you in 7 days? Would it really kill you, or is it's dosage safe for grown-ups but harmful for kids? Why would it be fine for adults but not kids anyway? I found myself hiding from my dad's vision, peering at the small images the TV in the distance displayed.</p>\n<p>I couldn't see what was even going on, let alone comprehend the rather complicated plot. Like I said, I was hiding and cowering far from the TV and my dad's line of sight. At the same time, the emotions of anxiety and tension still got to me. It was a combination of the steely cinematography, the occasional gore, the fact was fact that I was watching something that would supposedly kill me in a week, and the constant fear of getting caught by my dad.</p>\n<p>I wasn't completely ignorant to the concept of horror movies, as I watched movie with horror elements before. I've been startled and frightened by those Green Goblin scenes in the Raimi <em>Spider-Man</em> movies. I rented <em>Monster House</em> frequently. However, those movies only had moments of sparse horror, they were kid's movies after all. <em>The Ring</em>, however, was not (although like <em>Spider-Man</em> it's rated PG-13, but don't let me get started about the MPAA's asinine rating system). It was the first time I was deeply unsettled by a movie during its entire runtime. I knew this wasn't something I was supposed to watch, and it gave me a profound sense of disturbance I didn't know movies could conjure.</p>\n<p>Going to sleep was a complete struggle. I couldn't tell my parents what was bothering me, since they'd know I watched the forbidden movie. I just had to internalize all my fears and hope I'd live to see another day. It didn't help that we had an old CRT TV directly in front of my bed, but as far as I was concerned that crazy spirit could easily fit through that 12 inch display.</p>\n<p>A week passed, and both me and my dad were still alive. I still didn't feel great, but I was sleeping just fine. Still, this wouldn't be the first time I saw something that unsettled me for a while.</p>\n<h2>What I Saw</h2>\n<p>When I was around 7 or 8, I was shown a clip from <em>Saw II</em> from YouTube. Yes, even back then YouTube was committing child endangerment with their reckless recommendations. I have no idea why I was recommended the clip, but regardless I clicked on it. Anyway, the clip was of the opening. At the time I had no clue what was going on, other than the fact that some guy had to dig through his eye with a scalpel to find a key that would release him from a Venus fly trap mask.</p>\n<p>The editing, the disorienting cinematography, the sound effects, and the music's increasing intensity all petrified me. I remember thinking at the time that this guy would find a way to survive. The idea of someone not being able to survive in a movie was inconceivable to me, so I kept watching knowing I'd be spared of the gore-fest that would result when the trap closed. He ended up dying, and the shot of the blood coming from his skull was indwelled into my young brain.</p>\n<p>After the clip, I was terrified of going out and getting randomly kidnapped by some guy who would trap me like that. Once again, I couldn't just tell my parents what traumatized me. Their reaction to me watching edgy clips on the internet would be even more frightening than whatever Jigsaw could do to me. Instead, I practiced my same internalization mechanisms, and endured the nightmares for as long as they lasted.</p>\n<h2>It's Funny in Hindsight</h2>\n<p>At this point, I grew desensitized to most horror movies and clips. I remember watching clips from <em>Scream</em> on YouTube, and while they did scare me while watching them, they didn't make me fear serial killers like <em>Saw II</em> did. I watched stories about vengeful spirits and ghosts, but once again, I knew not to fear them like I did with <em>The Ring</em>. Ultimately, horror movies just didn't hit anymore.</p>\n<p>I occasionally foray into the genre and watch classics like <em>The Exorcist</em>, <em>Alien</em>, <em>Jaws</em>, <em>The Shining</em>, <em>Se7en</em>, <em>Videodrome</em>, and <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. I just can't find myself to be terrified while watching them. This is not to say I don't appreciate these movies, in fact some of the ones I listed are actually some of my all-time favorites. However, none of them gave me the same level of uneasiness as the movies I saw when I was a kid.</p>\n<p>Some came close, the gloomy environment <em>Eraserhead</em> was brilliant, depressing and creepy, but it didn't give me the same existential dread <em>The Ring</em> gave me. <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> was a great thrill when I saw it in theaters, but it didn't give me the same terrifying excitement the opening of <em>Saw II</em> did.</p>\n<p>I even went back and rewatched that opening clip of <em>Saw II</em>. I can't help but laugh at how unserious it is. The cinematography I thought was \"relentless\" was just jarring and distracting. I didn't know what was happening when I saw it as a kid, but I can't blame my past self, since even I couldn't tell what was happening as an adult. Was the key in his eye, lodged behind it, what was going on there? I checked the comment sections and most people also seemed confused. This scene is more laughably convoluted than terrifying in hindsight.</p>\n<p>I never saw the American version of <em>The Ring</em> fully. Rewatching clips of it, it does seem very cheesy and overproduced, especially after watching the Japanese original <em>Ringu</em> as an adult. I think <em>Ringu</em> is brilliant, and its slow pacing, realism, and psychological drama really got under my skin as I was watching it. It was one of the few times a movie affected me that much since, well, <em>The Ring</em>. However, I didn't get nightmares the night after watching the movie.</p>\n<h2>The Game</h2>\n<p>Horror games do get to me very easily, however. I think interactivity can provoke fear more easily than you can get from watching a movie. When you see a character back themselves into a corner while being chased by a serial killer, you can't help but not feel a little baffled by their actions. However, when <em>you're</em> the one backing into a corner in a frenzied state, then you get it.</p>\n<p>I tried playing <em>BioShock</em> but I kept getting frightened and annoying my roommates, so I stopped playing it out of embarrassment. I would like to pick it up again some day, but I need to find the time (and courage) to do so first.</p>\n<p>The <em>Fallout</em> series is potent nightmare fuel, as a kid I hated crawling through the metro in <em>Fallout 3</em> and getting jumped by ghouls and Super Mutants. In <em>Fallout 4</em> the creepiness from the metros came back in full form, and going through them for the first time as a 15 year old made me feel like I was playing <em>Fallout 3</em> for the first time as an 8 year old. Despite being isometric, <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> both had great ambience due to the music, visuals, and pervasively dour mood throughout the game (well for <em>Fallout 1</em> and most <em>2</em> at least).</p>\n<p>Like the original <em>Fallout</em> games, <em>Project Zomboid</em> is a great isometric game, even though it has old school Runescape graphics, it might be the most realistic and immersive game I've ever played. It's certainly has the most depth for any survival simulation game I've played. Fighting a zombie in that game felt like trying to fight a zombie in real life, so I always closed the curtains in that game to avoid such an experience. When I first played that game, I remember being paranoid about the open curtains in my real life house.</p>\n<p>I think what really amplified the horror element was knowing that there is no pre-determined outcome for your character. Unlike in <em>BioShock</em>, where if you screw up the consequences are minimal, in <em>Zomboid</em> one screw up could lead to the permanent death of your character (and therefore save). All that grinding you've done for hours can be wiped away because you got careless when fighting a zombie (or in my case eating burnt steak).</p>\n<p>My point is that I just concluded that I was too old and too desensitized to be as affected by the cinematic genre. The lack of interactivity makes movies less immersive than games, and therefore less scary than games. Having that level of detachment from yourself and the characters makes the whole story less intense.</p>\n<p>The whole idea of making something that's entertaining by provoking negative emotions in you is interesting to me. It seems counterintuitive, but horror movies are just as commercially viable and mainstream as movies in other genres (if not more so). I'm drawn to the genre's themes, imagery, and overall craft, yet I never profoundly experienced the emotions the genre was supposed to illicit. That is until I saw <em>The Witch</em> a few nights ago.</p>\n<h1>The Witch</h1>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why Horror Movies Don't Scare Me (Until I Saw this One)","description":"I'm fascinated by the horror genre, but I've never gotten scared by movies since I was a child.
