              Welcome to my personal share of the internet! I hope this website gets you to know me
              better, and where's about better place to start than my <i>About Me</i>?
            </p>

            {/*TODO: AFTER graduation, change all college-related stuff to be past-tense.
              Also perhaps make a hypernlink to the skills page?*/}
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Long Island, New York. After high school, I ventured across
              the country for college, <b>the University of California, Los Angeles.</b> Here I am
              obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics of Computation. The cool thing about
              my major is its versatility allows me to enroll in classes in math, computer science,
              and statistics. You can see the skills and courses I've taken in my <b>Skills</b>{' '}
              page.
            </p>

            <p>
              I recently graduated from UCLA and my current goal is to launch my career, 
              particularly ones involving data science. I am drawn by the potential of using analytics 
              to solve problems, answer questions, and discover operational strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
              My personal interests incude sports (especially my New York Giants), cinema, rock music, 
              photography, biking, fitness, and coffee brewing. I often go on lengthy discussions about
              these subjects, such as reviewing the latest movie I saw or sharing my progress in my
              fitness journey. Why not publish my opinions somewhere so my friends can access them
              on their own demand and with nicely structured presenteation?
            </p>

            {/* Add hyperlinks to blog categories */}
            <p>
              In addition to providing background information about myself, I'm hoping this website
              can showcase the two sides of my brain. The findings my &quot;left brain&quot; (i.e.
              the technical side) discovers will be posted as blogs in the <b>Analytics</b>{' '}
              category. The <b>Opinions</b> category will consist of blogs about topics my
              &quot;right brain&quot; (or the creative side) finds intriguing.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy my content here!</p>
